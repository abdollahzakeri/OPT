When I applied for OPT post bachelors it took 1 month and I applied 4/22/22 and received my card like a month later. Being the end of July I definitely am a little anxious but it seems like there's a few of us in the same situation.\",\n",

I didn't make any request.\\n\\nThe mailboxes were being renovated and the leasing office couldn't find anything in my name. Went to usps office, raised a lost mail request. If I remember correctly, I had to wait 30 days or something after the request was raised to get a letter from the branch manager which I could then submit to USCIS to reissue.\\n\\nBut very fortunately, when I checked 2-3 weeks later with the leasing office, top of the stack was a mail from USCIS with my EAD card.\",\n",
