Aug 22: wait time is 7 months. Aug 23: 8 months. I am currently out of the country in Europe and supposed to fly back on Sep 8. With the trends I see on here, looks like it's a wild card whether or not I'll be approved by then. I do have a few gigs lined up (freelance musician) that I could show proof of in addition to my OPT authorized F-1 (expired). I'll keep updating.

P. S. I also left to go home to Canada for about a week in late June and then re-entered the US as a visitor. Does anyone know if this could hinder my application in any way?

Finally, after an agonizing 92 days! The start date I initially put is long gone, so have no idea what the new start date is going to be.

A few things I was confused about that got clarified - hopefully it helps someone in the future!

1. My processing time changed from 2 months to 5 months after I got the SEVP email and is now at 3 months.
2. My start date was moved to the date my card got approved (outside 60-day window). But end date stays the same, so my 12-month OPT got shortened to 11 months.

"I have a question. Does ""estimate processing time"" really matter? My receipt date is 4/22, but it still shows 5 months. However, I've seen people having receipt dates like 4/26 and 4/28 see their estimated processing time now 4 months. Does it mean mine will take longer than the ones that show 4-month indications?",,,2025-04-22,,,,,,,User notes receipt date 4/22 with a 5-month estimate; contrasts with others having receipt dates 4/26 and 4/28 showing 4 months.

Thankful I found this thread because I have been starting to lose my mind over the randomly fluctuating processing times listed by my application (keeps flip flopping from 5mo-11mo and back). When I applied for OPT post bachelors it took 1 month and I applied 4/22/22 and received my card like a month later. Being the end of July I definitely am a little anxious but it seems like there's a few of us in the same situation.",STEM OPT,Yes,2025-04-10,2025-08-14,,2025-08-18,,,2025-08-05,

I was initially worried because the estimated processing time remained at 5 months, even though others were seeing shorter timeframes. But it stayed the same even after I received my approval email, so there's really no need to stress about it!

Also, I had been expecting the approval email to arrive in my personal inbox, but it ended up in the junk folder of my school email. So be sure to check your spam/junk folders regularly.

Hi everyone! Thank you all for sharing your timelines. This has been incredibly helpful. I‚Äôm hoping to get your opinions based on mine. My receipt date is April 22, and I really need to receive the actual EAD card by August 18 at the latest.

Do you think that‚Äôs possible without applying for premium processing? If I need to do it, this might be my last chance. My application is with the Irving Center, and the USCIS portal still shows a 5-month processing time.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any insights.
