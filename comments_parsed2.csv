**RE: Optional Practical Training Approval - the next step. Create a SEVP Portal account.**  
  
I received my physical copy of the approval notice on 26th August, which mentioned a start date of 18th August. Unfortunately, I haven't received my EAD card yet, and according to online status, the card has been produced. 

Now I have a question about which date my 90-day clock will start: 

1. 18th August, as mentioned in the physical copy.

2. 26th Aug as I got a physical copy in hand.

3. The date when I will receive a physical EAD. 

Appreciate your help and support!",post-completion,,,,,,,,,"OPT type: post-completion. Start date mentioned: 7 July. Email approval received on 19 August.

"Hi everyone!

I have a receipt date of May 2, 2025 and today, myProgress tab went up from 2 months to 4 months. Is that a good sign? I saw people have been getting theirs approved a couple days after that has happened to them. Anyone around my receipt date got theirs approved yet? 

Also, I did ask for an expedite request on Aug 21, 2025 bc I literally lost one of my positions from my job offer package. I'm really trying to hold off PP because that'd be worth almost two months of my income. If I did have that job and paid PP before, the money back would be equivalent to not having that job anyways but I really need it for my other jobs.

Please, someone share your thoughts. Thank you!

OPT Applied: March 27, 2025

RFE Issued: June 13, 2025

RFE Response Submitted: June 24, 2025

Status: No updates since the RFE response submission


It’s been almost two months without any movement in my case. I’m beginning to wonder whether I may have submitted my RFE response in the wrong format, and if that could potentially be holding things up.

Has anyone encountered a similar situation? Is it normal for USCIS to take this long after an RFE response, or should I be taking additional steps (such as contacting them, requesting an inquiry, or seeking congressional help)?

Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated.",OPT,,2025-03-27,,,,,,,OPT Applied: 2025-03-27; RFE Issued: 2025-06-13; RFE Response Submitted: 2025-06-24; Status: No updates since the RFE response submission.

I'm supposed to be contracted to work on August 16, but the actual time when I start working is actually in early September. The portal also shows 2 months' wait time, but I'm seeing people around late-April getting their approvals. Should I go PP? And do I need my EAD to be hired or just proof of OPT approval? Does the start date show on the approval or just EAD card?

Also, I applied via mail. Does anyone know if they are going to email me the approval or send it via mail? I imagine that it'd show up on the portal because they uploaded my mailed-in documents onto it, but I'm not sure.

I'd really appreciate the advice!

UPDATE: I logged into my USCIS today (Sun 8/10) and the progress tab disappeared... does that mean a decision was made about my OPT or just a glitch?!?

UPDATE 2: Looks like it was just a stupid glitch :(

While waiting for my EAD card application, I had an EMERGENCY to leave the U.S., and now I have a job offer (offer letter) that requires me to come back to the country before mid-August. The thing is, international shipping does not seem like a very sure option because it can be blocked at my country's borders or postal office and keep it there for months with other people's packages/envelopes.  
I am thinking about booking a flight to re-enter the U.S. and deliver the card to my roommate, who will bring it to me at the Airport when I get there. Does this seem okay or too risky? Who has had a similar situation, please?

"Hey guys need some help with my case. I applied for stem opt extension on 4/11 and have not received any update. Initial opt expires in 6/30 which places my 180days automatic extension to 12/30. I work for a none-profit company that’s willing to file H1b for me if opt extension gets denied. My question: if I were to get denied after 8/30, will I still have a 60 day grace period to file for H1B or do I have to leave the country immediately? 

I’ve heard a mix of things. Some say depart immediately because I would have passed the 60 day grace period following initial opt on 8/30. But USCIS policy manual says “If the extension is denied, employment authorization is immediately terminated and the F-1 student’s status ends in 60 days from the date of denial.” Which will mean I get 2months to file H1B while being put on unpaid leave.

Any thoughts?",Stem OPT extension,,2024-04-11,,,,,,,"Applied for STEM OPT extension on 2024-04-11. Initial OPT expires 2024-06-30 with 180-day automatic extension to 2024-12-30.

I just wanted to share this as I know I’ve seen a lot of people waiting for their card to travel internationally. I wanted to travel to Canada to see some family but I didn’t have my new EAD card yet, so I thought I couldn’t. I spoke to my DSO (who I really, really trust) and she told me I was ok to travel even without my new card as long as my F1 visa hadn’t expired. She told me to print off my receipt notice and take it with me. I was nervous but went ahead and did it anyway because I was desperate to see my family. 
My STEM OPT extension was approved before I left the country but my EAD was delivered while I was still abroad in Canada so I didn’t have it for my travels. I re entered the US today and they only asked to see my visa and I-20, no request to see my EAD or even my receipt notice. It was an extremely smooth process for me so I just wanted to share with anyone else in a similar situation - this obviously doesn’t guarantee anything for anyone else but thought someone else might benefit from hearing about my.

He asked the officer to correct it, but they said the spelling was from Immigration and that they couldn’t change it. However, the officer did update the spelling in the computer and gave him another paper with the correct spelling, stating that he has applied for the Social Security card.

My question is: Has anyone else experienced a similar situation?
